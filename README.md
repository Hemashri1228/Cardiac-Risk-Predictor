# Heart Failure Analysis and Prediction Using Clinical Record Dataset

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 17 million deaths annually. These diseases manifest primarily as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and heart failures. Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's needs.

With the availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), it is now possible to analyze patients' symptoms, physical characteristics, and clinical laboratory test values. Such data can be leveraged to perform statistical analyses, revealing patterns and correlations that may not be easily detected by medical professionals. By applying machine learning techniques, we can predict patients' survival based on their clinical data and identify the most critical features impacting their outcomes.

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can:
1. Predict a patient's survival based on their medical records.
2. Rank the importance of various attributes in determining the likelihood of survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project classifies whether patients have heart disease or not, based on several clinical features. The data includes a variety of attributes that describe patient symptoms, medical test results, and other relevant characteristics.

## Methods

Several machine learning classifiers are applied to the dataset. The objectives are twofold:
1. **Prediction**: To determine if a patient is likely to have heart disease based on their clinical data.
2. **Feature Ranking**: To identify which features contribute the most to the prediction, helping to better understand the key factors influencing heart failure.

The analysis and modeling are performed using Python and libraries such as:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn** for implementing machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

## Results

The trained model aims to:
- Accurately predict heart failure risk for individual patients.
- Provide insights into which features (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels) are most strongly correlated with heart failure outcomes.

This project has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in better understanding the factors contributing to heart failure, ultimately improving early diagnosis and treatment strategies for patients at risk.

## Conclusion

With the help of machine learning and available clinical data, this project demonstrates the power of predictive models in the healthcare sector. By analyzing patients' medical records, we can not only predict their likelihood of heart failure but also gain valuable insights into the underlying factors affecting heart health.
